       Compressed	Compressed RGB texture. This is the most common format for diffuse textures. 4 bits per pixel (32 KB for a 256x256 texture).
        16 bit	Low-quality truecolor. Has 16 levels of red, green, blue and alpha.
        Truecolor	Truecolor, this is the highest quality. At 256 KB for a 256x256 texture.
        Crunched	Crunch is a lossy compression format on top of DXTR texture compression. Textures will be converted to DXT when uploading the GPU at runtime. Crunch compression helps achieving the lowest possible size footprint on disk and for downloads. Crunch textures can take very long to compress, but decompression at runtime is very fast.

probably all textures compressed
gui truecolor
